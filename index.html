    <p>A table can be used several ways on a page but one thing all tables have in common is that they are all used to present information in an organized way.</p><br>
    <p>If you are looking to create a table on a web page, there are several things that you need to know.</p><br>
      <p>One of the most important things you need to know before you can create a table using HTML are your table tags.</p>
      <p>We are going to cover this later on as it is the most important thing you need to know when creating a table but before that, there are several things you need to be aware of before creating a table</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>You should know the element tags of a table</li>
        <li>You should have a good idea of how you plan to arrange the table</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Building a table can be fun if you know what you are doing.</p><br>
    <p>But before you jump in to start building a table there are several things that you should already know.</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>You should know how to use HTML to create content on a page</li>
        <li>You should know how to use CSS as this would make it easy when customizing your table</li>
      </ul>
    </code>

  <section class="main-section"  id="HTML_Table_Tags">
    <header style="font-size: 30px;">HTML Table Tags</header>
    <code>
    <p>There are several tags that you need to know to create a table.</p><br>
    <p>I would list and explain some of these tags below and later leave a reference where you can get more information on creating a table.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</li><br><p>This is considered the first tag to use when creating a table. Nothing happens here until you place other tags within it. 
        All this tag does is that it creates a table where you are to place your content</p>
        <li>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</li><br>
        <p>This adds tags for rows. Depending on how many you want would determine how many of its opening and closing tags you would include.<br><br>
        Just using this tag would make any data display on the table. You must define each cell element and you would add data using the <strong>table data element &lt;td&gt</strong></p>
        <li>&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</li>
        <p>As we already mentioned, this allows us to input data with the tags which would then appear on the form of cells. Below is a representation of a simple table with styling.</p><br>
        <table id="first_table" style="text-decoration: none">
  <tr>
    <td>Adamâ€™s Greenworks</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>Package Items</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>
        <li>&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;</li>
        <p>We add headings to the contents of a table by making use of this tag. It must be placed within the &lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; tag</p>
      </ul>
    </code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section"  id="HTML_Table_Scope_Attribute">
    <header style="font-size: 30px;">HTML Table Scope Attribute</header>
    <code>
    <p>Two scope attributes that you can use in your table are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>row: by using this value, it makes it clear that the heading is for a row</li>
        <li>col: this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column</li><br>
        <p>There are other attributes that we use when creating a table</p>
        <li>colspan: we use this attribute to create a column to span more than one cell. Using this attribute creates data that spans multiple columns and it accepts an integer as a value to denote the number of columns it would occupy</li>
        <li>rowspan: This works in a similar way to colspan but instead of spanning through columns it spans through row.</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="main-section"  id="HTML_Table_Styling">
    <header style="font-size: 30px;">HTML Table Styling</header>
    <code>
    <p>Plain HTML without the use of CSS would make any content look plain and the same can be said about a table. To style a table you need to have some knowledge on how to use CSS.</p><br>
    <p>Without that, your table would come out in a way you probably do no like. .</p>
      <p>At the end of the post you would see a table with styling so you understand just what I mean.</p>
